  <title>Access Control</title>

  <para>
    Access to hardware by unprivileged users is traditionally granted
    in two ways either by granting access to the <emphasis>special
    device file</emphasis> or allowing access through another process,
    using IPC acting on behalf of the user. HAL follows the latter
    model and uses the system-wide message bus (D-Bus) as the IPC
    mechanism. In addition, HAL has support for modifying the ACL's
    (access control lists) on a device file to grant/revoke access to
    users based on several criteria.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="access-control-device-file">
    <title>Device Files</title>
    <para>
      If HAL is built with <literal>--enable-acl-management</literal>
      (requires both <literal>--enable-console-kit</literal>
      and <literal>--enable-policy-kit</literal>) then ACL's on device
      objects with the capability <literal>access_control</literal>
      are automatically managed according to the properties defined in
      <xref linkend="device-properties-access-control"/>. In addition,
      for this configuration, HAL ships with a device information file
      (normally installed in
      <literal>/usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-acl-management.fdi</literal>)
      that merges this capability on device objects that are normally
      accessed by unprivileged users through the device file. This
      includes e.g. sound cards, webcams and other devices but
      excludes drives and volumes as the latter two are normally
      accessed by a user through mounting them into the file system.
    </para>
    <para>
      HAL uses PolicyKit to decide what users should have access
      according to PolicyKit configuration; see the PolicyKit
      privilege definition
      file <literal>/usr/share/PolicyKit/policy/org.freedesktop.hal.device-access.policy</literal>
      on a system with HAL installed for the default access suggested
      by the HAL package and/or OS vendor.
    </para>
    <para>
      In addition, 3rd party packages can supply device information
      files to specify (via
      the <literal>access_control.grant_user</literal>
      and <literal>access_control.grant_group</literal> properties)
      that a given user or group should always have access to a device
      file. This is useful for system-wide software (such as AV
      streaming management) that runs as an unprivileged system
      user. This interface is supposed to be stable so 3rd party
      packages can depend on it.

    <para>
      If HAL is built without ConsoleKit support
      (e.g. without <literal>--enable-console-kit</literal>) access to
      the various D-Bus interfaces that provides mechanisms is only
      protected by the D-Bus security configuration files
      (e.g. using <literal>at_console</literal> to restrict to console
      user on Red Hat systems) and, in certain cases, restricted to
      the super user.
    </para>
    <para>
      If ConsoleKit support is enabled, access to D-Bus interfaces is
      currently hardcoded to only allow active users at the system
      console. If PolicyKit support is enabled, the PolicyKit library
      will be in charge of determining access; see the PolicyKit
      privilege definition files
      in <literal>/etc/PolicyKit/privileges</literal> on a system with
      HAL installed for the default access suggested by the HAL
      package and/or OS vendor.
